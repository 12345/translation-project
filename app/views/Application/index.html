                    Play is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture and features predictable and minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for highly-scalable applications - thanks to its reactive model, based on Iteratee IO.

        <h2>Re-play history</h2>
        <p>
            Since 2007, we've been working on making Java web application development easier. Play started as an internal project at Zenexity and was heavily influenced by our way of doing web projects: focusing on developer productivity, respecting Web architecture, and from the start employing a fresh approach to packaging conventions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, technology and the Web have continued to evolve. The Web has become a central point of all applications. HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies have evolved quickly - making it almost impossible for a server-side framework to keep up. 
        </p>
        <p>Today, the entire Web architecture is moving quickly towards real-time. Project requirements have 
morphed too - meaning previous staples, such as SQL are no longer our exclusive datastore technology. At the programming language level we've witnessed some monumental changes: with several JVM languages, including Scala, gaining popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's why we created Play 2.0, <a href="/documentation/latest/Philosophy">a new Web framework for a new era</a>.
