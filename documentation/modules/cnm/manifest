description: >
  The content negotiation module helps using content types which are not directly supported by the Play! framework such as VCard and Atom/RSS feeds. For this it provides a list of default types which are automatically mapped to the correct template (like .vcf). You can also define your own mappings using a simple properties file. All the boilerplate code around it will be handled by this module.
