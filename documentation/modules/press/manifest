name: Minimize javascript/css files

description: >
  The press module is a JavaScript and CSS minimizer that is designed to be transparent to the application developer:
  Simply replace script tags with #{press.script} tags.
  
  
  It is a simplified version of the greenscript module, with the difference that greenscript allows the developer to set up a dependency graph, whereas press can be switched on and off easily and therefore makes it easier to debug JavaScript and CSS.
