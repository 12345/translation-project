description: >
  The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Siena module generates a fully usable web interface for your Siena Model objects.
  
  
  WARNING:
  
  * CrudSiena Version 1.1 works with Play! v1.1 but not v1.0.x
  
  * CrudSiena Version 1.0 & 1.01 works with Play! v1.0.3.2 but not v1.1. 
  
  This is the exact ghost module of the original Play! CRUD module : JpaSupport has just become SienaSupport and it manages some Siena specific features such as Embedded objects.
  
  
  There are some differences linked to Siena and some new features such as the datepicker/datetimepicker.
  
  
  You can find the full how-to on the googlecode project site.
  
  
  Don't hesitate to report issues and propositions for enhancements there also!!!
