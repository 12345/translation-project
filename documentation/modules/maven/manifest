description: >
  This module lets you manage your dependencies with apache maven.
  
  
  Expected behavior this module:
  
  
  # Allow declaration dependencies in pom.xml, without putting explicitly unless the transitive dependency does not work (for older version or depending on undesirable big jar file)
  
  # Able to download all dependencies not provided by Play into lib folder, with src and javadoc
  
  # Able to download source/javadoc artifiacts to depsrc folder for declared or transitive dependency which is provided by Play, for easier debugging (using command mvn:play-src) 
  
  
  There is something I am consciously trying to avoid:
  
  # Long download time.
  
  # Handle classpath.
  
  # Change Play's structure.
