description: >
  elp app developer to easily implement navigation menu. Basically with the module what you need to do is:
  
  
  # create menu structure file (_menu.yml) in YAML format
  
  # put "#{menu.menu /}" tag in proper place of your main.html file 
  
  Yes, that's all!
  
  
  for detail, please refer to document
  
  
  Note, Menu module itself shall be able to run on Play-1.0. However the demo app needs Play-morphia-1.1 to run, which in turn relies on Play-1.1beta2
  
  
  Many thanks to roymax@gmail.com who test and report issues of this module
