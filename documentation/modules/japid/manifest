name: Japid template engine

description: >
  A fast template engine that borrows the basic syntax of Play! and the spirit of Jamon.
  
  
  The initial benchmark has shown near raw Java performance, 2X - 20X times faster than the built-in Play! template engine and 3X as much total web throughput with Play!.
  
  
  The module is current at version 0.5.4 level.
  
  
  Please go to the project home page for readme and wiki documentations. The PDF in the download section is a little out of date.
  
  
  It's compatible with Play 1.0.2 and the 1.1 development branch as of 8/15/2010.
